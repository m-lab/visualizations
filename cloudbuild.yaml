# We have $_IMAGE_PROJECT in a Cloud Build user-defined substitution variable
# because this build gets run in more projects that just the standard
# sandbox->staging->prod, but those projects are the only ones where the
# container images are built and pushed to Artifact Registry. The other
# production project where this build will happen is "measurement-lab", which
# is a production project, so we want to use the "mlab-oti" (prod) image. The
# value of this variable is defined in the build trigger of each project.
